##Joe McCaffrey's Portfolio Page

This serves as a portfolio page in the form of a react app hosted on git hub pages.  

<br>

The branch structure is:
- Main: all the main code for the development side of the vite based react app
- gh-pages: holds the deployed react app which serves the hosted [git hub pages page](https://caffreydev.github.io).  Note this is auto deployed on commits to main via the yaml file calling the `deploy` script in the package.json file
- Other: depending on when you look at the page there may be one or more feature branches open that I am working on before merging back into main
