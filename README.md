##Joe McCaffrey's Portfolio Page

This serves as a portfolio page in the form of a react app hosted on git hub pages.  

<br>

The branch structure is:
- Main: all the main code for the development side of the vite based react app
- gh-pages: holds the deployed react app which serves the hosted [git hub pages page](https://www.joemccaffrey.dev).  Note this is auto deployed on pushes to main via the `autodeploy_on_push.yml` workflow file.
- Other: depending on when you look at the page there may be one or more feature branches open that I am working on before merging back into main
