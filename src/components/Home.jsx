        <p>I am Joe McCaffrey, a full stack Javascript software engineer, with experience in web design, building out api servers,
            game design, databases, and data science and analysis.  
            <br />
            That's the TLDR bio - for developers and those more technically minded please check out my (longer) bio on my github profile,
            available through the Socials page linked in the above nav bar.          
        </p>
        <p>
            This site serves as a simple profile, to link to some of my projects and other works, as well as my social feeds in one place.
            intend in the very near future to also add a blog and newsletter where I will be commenting on developments in the technology space.
